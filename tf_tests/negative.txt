The film is formulaic and derivative with few redeeming features. The plot is weak, predictable and dull with no sense of threat, and the few moments of awe or surprise are fleeting. There's a variety of settings and scenes, but they all end in the same way. The special effects are mostly sub-par, and the costumes look cheap and tacky. The acting is good, but there's no real character development and the forced humour is awful.
