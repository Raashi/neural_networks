I got the chance to watch this movie at special screening and I must say I was blown away. Never ever had I expected this movie to be this beautiful and visually stunnning. Amazing performance of all the star cast was 'Icing on the cake.' Jason Momoa, Nicole Kidman, Amber Heard, Wilem Dafoe, Patrick Wilson all gave justice to their roles. This movie is definitely going to give DCEU a lifeline and after Aquaman, I really want James Wan to direct more DCEU movies in future.
